Info on how to setup organigram for EEA
=================================================
Author: Alexandru Ghica <alec.ghica@eaudeweb.ro>


1) By default the eeastaff.xml should be available under
 ../eea-buildout/var

2) On your EEA Plone root a ATFile (ID = 'eeastaff') should be created

3) Under /portal_properties/eeastaff_properties you can set:
    - organisations to be displayed
    - the filenames from 1) and 2)

4) A cron job should be set in order to update the eeastaff.xml
on the file system

5) After updating the eeastaff.xml, the cron job should call
http://eea.europa.eu/@@updateOrganigram in order to update the
Plone file (eeastaff)


Specific EEA information
=================================================
The cron responsable for update is found on Albatross: /etc/cron.daily/syncstaff
