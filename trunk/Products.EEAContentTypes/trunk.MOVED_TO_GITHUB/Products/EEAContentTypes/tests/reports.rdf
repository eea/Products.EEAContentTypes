   <title>Feasibility study: Modelling environmental concentrations of chemicals from emission data</title>
     <link>http://reports.eea.europa.eu/technical_report_2007_8</link>
<description><![CDATA[The purpose of this feasibility study is to develop a toolbox of available methodologies and a work plan for applying relevant models to substances reported under the European Pollution Emission Register (EPER) in order to predict the composition and distribution of these chemicals in the European environment - in effect, the 'chemical density' of Europe. The study aims to identify which of the available chemical models are sufficiently validated and accepted to be used in a policy context and which models are suitable for substances listed under EPER. The focus of the study will therefore be specifically on models suitable for large industrial point source emissions, with emphasis on models suitable for manufactured chemicals and heavy
metals.]]></description>

   <title>Towards a European Chemicals Information System: a survey on reported monitoring activities of chemicals in Europe</title>
     <link>http://reports.eea.europa.eu/technical_report_2007_6</link>
<description><![CDATA[This report presents the outline and results of a project which collected information on monitoring activities in the 32 EEA member countries. In addition, a framework is proposed on the potential structure of a multi-purpose European chemicals information system where a database on monitoring activities would constitute one element. The system could be used as a tool in support of EU chemicals and environmental legislation.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[This report reviews the state and application of substance flow analysis (SFA) methodology in selected European Environment Agency (EEA) member countries. The objective is to explore if and how the existing practices could serve as a methodological framework for a macro-level, Europe-wide application of the SFA methodology to gather information on chemical substances. ]]></description>

   <title>Priority issues in the Mediterranean environment (revised version)</title>
     <link>http://reports.eea.europa.eu/eea_report_2006_4</link>
<description><![CDATA[The environment around the Mediterranean Sea region will not improve until there is the political will to enforce current and future environment legislation, says a new report, launched today. 'Priority issues in the Mediterranean Environment', a joint report by the European Environment Agency (EEA) and the UNEP Mediterranean Action Plan (MAP), was launched at a meeting of the Contracting Parties of the Barcelona Convention, taking place in Portoroz, Slovenia. The report, which scans existing and emerging pollution issues, draws a picture at the regional level but also provides an environmental profile for each of the Mediterranean countries.]]></description>

   <title>The European environment - State and outlook 2005 </title>
     <link>http://reports.eea.europa.eu/state_of_environment_report_2005_1</link>
<description><![CDATA[This is the third state and outlook report on the European environment produced by the European Environment Agency (EEA) since 1994. Looking back, the last report, published in 1999 concluded that, despite 25 years of Community environmental policy, environmental quality in the European Union (EU) was mixed and that the unsustainable development of some key economic sectors was the major barrier to further improvements. That remains the EEA's key conclusion, despite significant progress on some issues demonstrating that environmental policy works. Were we to fast-forward to the year 2010, it would be my strong hope that in its next state and outlook report, the EEA would be able to report significant environmental improvements, not least as a result of reversing unsustainable trends in sectors such as energy, agriculture and transport.]]></description>

This assessment is the most comprehensive up-to-date overview currently available of the state of the environment on this continent. In contrast to previous reports issued in 1995 and 1998, it covers for the first time the entire Russian Federation and the 11 other Eastern European, Caucasus and Central Asian (EECCA) states. The report also analyses how the main economic driving forces put pressure on the European environment and identifies key areas where further action is needed. </description>

   <title>Europe's environment: the third assessment [Summary]</title>
     <link>http://reports.eea.europa.eu/environmental_assessment_report_2003_10-sum</link>
<description><![CDATA[This is the third pan-European state of the environment report produced by the EEA. It was prepared for the 'Environment for Europe' Ministerial Conference being held under the auspices of the UN Economic Commission for Europe in Kiev, Ukraine on 21-23 May 2003. This assessment is the most comprehensive up-to-date overview currently available of the state of the environment on this continent. In contrast to previous reports issued in 1995 and 1998, it covers for the first time the entire Russian Federation and the 11 other Eastern European, Caucasus and Central Asian (EECCA) states. The report also analyses how the main economic driving forces put pressure on the European environment and identifies key areas where further action is needed. ]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[The report for 1996 summarises the main results and points to future work needed. In 1996 the ETC/NC became increasingly involved in the Agency?s reporting tasks and in collaboration with other ETCs, but the main tasks were still continuations of work started in 1995.]]></description>

         <description>In this present report it is shown that there are few environmental problems in Europe that cannot be traced back to some sort of excessive loading of chemicals. Economic development has been driven to a considerable extent by progress and innovation achieved by the chemical industry. This process has led to the marketing and use in different applications of ever-increasing numbers and quantities of chemical substances.</description>

         <link>http://reports.eea.europa.eu/92-826-5409-5/Chapter17</link>
         <description>This chapter considers the pressures on the environment and potential risks arising from the use and marketing of chemical substances and the development, production, field testing, and release through placing on the market of living, genetically modified organisms. Such substances or organisms may not necessarily be released directly into the environment, but may eventually end up there either during their production and use, or at the end of the product's useful lifetime.</description>

<description><![CDATA[Environmental change occurs as a result of both natural and human processes. Environmental systems and human activities contribute to environmental changes through the transformation and transportation of large quantities of energy and materials. Natural systems transform the sun's energy into living matter and cause changes by cycling materials through geological, biological, oceanic and atmospheric processes. Human activities transform materials and energy into products and services.]]></description>
